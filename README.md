## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and SEO-friendly tags.
* **CSS3:** Custom animations and Flexbox/Grid layouts.
* **JavaScript:** Simple animations.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Modern UI/UX:** utilizing modern design trends (hero sections, card layouts, clean typography).
* **Performance:** Optimized assets for fast load times.

## 🎨 Design & Motivation

I built this project to simulate a real-world client deliverable. I wanted to move away from "tutorial style" code and build a site that looks trustworthy and expensive that also
tells a bit about me.

I focused heavily on:
1.  **Visual Hierarchy:** Guiding the user's eye to the "Call to Action" buttons.
2.  **Whitespace:** Using negative space to create a clean, professional feel.
3.  **Brand Consistency:** Maintaining a consistent color palette and font usage throughout.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

* **CSS Architecture:** I learned how to organize my CSS to keep it maintainable, using variables for colors and fonts.
* **HTML Structure:** I faced a challenge getting the images to load on the page once it was live due to the structuring of my directories which was later fixed.
* **Design:** Simple is sometimes the best option as opposed to over complicating everything.

## Version 2.0 (Features to implement)

* **Make the project responsive**
* **Make the front-end faster**
* **Provide backend logic that would allow users to actually send info and email straight from the form**
* **New animations**
